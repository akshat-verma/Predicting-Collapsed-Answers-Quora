# Predicting-Collapsed-Answers-Quora
Scraped questions and answers topicwise on quora using Selenium (since quora requires user interaction and support dynamic content generation)
Created features by mining questions & answers textual content and using answerer's profile
Developed Random Forest Predictive model  capable of identifying unhelpful/low quality answers that should be collapsed in order to save the time of both users and moderators
